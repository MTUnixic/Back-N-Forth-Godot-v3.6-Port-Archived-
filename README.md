!! READ IF YOU WANT !!

- For this project specifically, use **Godot 3.6** as it is the version this godot project is built on, to include support for PS Vita by ThatOneHam.
- Do note that **THIS PROJECT IS ARCHIVED AND NO LONGER MAINTAINED!!!** This will only exist as an archive for those who are curious into modding or porting this version. But, this should never be used as a base engine as it is messy and just not worth breaking your head with to be honest. BUT, feel free to peek into it if you're interested!

- Be safe, and i wish you best of luck! :)
